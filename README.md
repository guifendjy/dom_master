dom_master: A Lightweight DOM Manipulation and Reactive Framework

dom_master is a minimal, vanilla JavaScript library designed to simplify 
dynamic DOM manipulation and create reactive user interfaces without the 
overhead of large frameworks. A little unconventional, it uses string literals to 
describe the UI, it uses TEXT_NODEs to enable users to conditionally render elements.
tho it gets the job done, it is limited, it does not work with elements with strict structures.

Key Features
	•	Reactive State Management: Bind data to the DOM and automatically update elements when state changes.
	•	Dynamic Rendering: Effortlessly handle loops (for:each, start:if) and conditional rendering with intuitive syntax.
	•	Fine-Grained Updates: Efficiently update only the necessary DOM elements to ensure high performance.
	•	No Build Tools: Works directly in the browser—no need for bundlers or transpilers.
	•	Custom Interactivity: Provides local state for dynamically created nodes, ensuring scoped reactivity.

Perfect for small-to-medium projects or as a building block for larger custom frameworks.
